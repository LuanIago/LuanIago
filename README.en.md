# 👋 Hi, I'm Luan!

I am passionate about technology and found in programming a way to turn ideas into real solutions. I focus on continuous learning and on applying theory in practice through exercises and projects.

Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in **PHP**, developing small projects, practicing programming logic daily, and improving code best practices. I am also preparing to move forward with **React** and **Java**, technologies that interest me for their robustness and potential in modern application development.
